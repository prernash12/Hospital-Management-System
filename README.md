About My Project:
This project is a Hospital Management System, which is like a digital assistant for hospitals. It helps in organizing patient information, scheduling appointments, and managing billing.

Patient Registration: Just like when you visit a hospital and fill out a form with your details, this system lets hospital staff register patients by entering their name, age, and gender.

Appointment Scheduling: Instead of manually writing down appointment details, this system allows hospital staff to schedule appointments with doctors by specifying the patient, doctor, and date.

Billing and Invoicing: After the appointment, the system automatically generates invoices for patients, detailing the services provided and the amount owed. This makes the billing process smoother and more efficient.

Overall, it's a digital tool that makes managing hospital operations easier, from registering patients to scheduling appointments and handling billing.
